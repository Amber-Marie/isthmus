  Can be run from cron, will periodically check if sims in the sims-enabled
  folder are down and if so will (re-)start them

  When sims start, they output a unix timestap to a lastrun file
  This way we can detect frequent crashes and disable that sim (remove it
  from the sims-enabled folder) and notify (mail) the user who is running
  the sims


simctl - make multi region aware (change region "root")
regionadd - add a region to a simulator
simadd - add a simulator (leave regions to regionadd)

regionmove x,y

  Move a region to pos x,y on the world map
  One of x or y can be ommited but the comma is mandatory
  When a - is used, move the region to the left/down from the current pos
  When a + is used, move the region to the right/up from the current pos

simtool - dialog frontend for sim management
  new region
  delete region
  change options
  start/stop/restart
  rename simulator

regiontool - dialog frontend for region management
  oar loading/saving
  terrain loading/saving
  moving position on the worldmap
  renaming the region

instead of sending command input to screen, use proper xml-rpc
this requires opening such a port for each simulator in the config, which also
implies the use of a firewall. which brings me to:

automatically open required firewall ports for http_listener and region (udp)
on adding a simulator/region (ufw in ubuntu)
