Easy and modular OpenSimulator management and deployment for Linux

Currently works out of the box for the following grids:

  * OsGrid
  * Metropolis

Other grids can add themselves, set your required grid specific files up in
/share/grids/YourGrid (see other grids), then do a pull request.

Users can refer to the user documentation in the doc folder
